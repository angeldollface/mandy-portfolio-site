# MANDY PORTFOLIO SITE :fire: :nail_care:

[![Mandy CI](https://github.com/angeldollface/mandy-portfolio-site/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/angeldollface/mandy-portfolio-site/actions/workflows/main.yml)

***The default template site for creating new Mandy-powered sites. :fire: :nail_care:***

## ABOUT :books:

Since I was browsing some layouts for portfolio website the other day on Dribble and I stumbled across a particularly interesting one, I thought I'd copy this design and make it in HTML and CSS. This repository contains the source code for this portfolio website template but for the static-site generator, Mandy! Enjoy. :heart:

## FEATURES :test_tube:

- SEO 
- Minimalist modern design.
- Easy to use.
- Multiple customization options.

## USAGE :hammer_and_pick:

To use this template site for your own Mandy-powered site, you need to have Mandy installed. To find out how to do that, head over to [this link](https://github.com/angeldollface/mandy). Once you have Mandy installed, you can use this template in the following way:

- 1.) Check you have the latest version of Mandy installed:

```bash
mandy -v
```

- 2.) Create a new Mandy-powered site using this template (`mysite` is the directory in which your new Mandy site will be created.):

```bash
mandy -i mysite -w angeldollface/mandy-portfolio-site
```

- 3.) Change into your site's root directory:

```bash
cd mysite
````

- 4.) Start the development server:

```bash
mandy -s .
```

- 5.) Open a browser window at the address that is output in the terminal session. Pretty rad, huh? :heart_on_fire:
